# xproof System Architecture

## High-Level Overview

xproof is a blockchain certification service that anchors SHA-256 file hashes on the MultiversX blockchain. Users upload files in the browser, which are hashed client-side using the Web Crypto API. The hash is then recorded as an immutable on-chain transaction, producing a verifiable proof of existence. Files never leave the user's browser.

```

### Key Frontend Modules

**hashFile.ts** -- Uses the Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle.digest`) to compute SHA-256 hashes entirely in the browser. The file content is read as an `ArrayBuffer` and hashed without any server communication, ensuring files never leave the client.

**multiversxTransaction.ts** -- Creates certification transactions with a structured data payload in the format `xproof:certify:<hash>|filename:<name>|author:<author>`. Handles nonce management, gas estimation, wallet provider signing (with timeout for 2FA/Guardian flows), and broadcasting via the MultiversX SDK TransactionManager.

**generateProofPDF.ts** -- Generates downloadable PDF certificates using jsPDF. Each PDF includes the file name, SHA-256 hash, MultiversX transaction hash, certification date, author name, and a QR code linking to the blockchain explorer.

**queryClient.ts** -- Configures TanStack React Query with a default fetch function for the backend API. All data fetching uses `useQuery` with strongly typed query keys, and mutations use `apiRequest` with cache invalidation.

---

## Backend Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon) with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Store:** PostgreSQL-backed sessions (connect-pg-simple)
- **Blockchain:** MultiversX SDK (sdk-core, sdk-wallet, sdk-native-auth-server)
- **Payments:** xMoney REST API (EGLD)

  vite.ts                 # Vite dev server integration and static file serving
```

### Middleware Chain

The Express middleware stack is applied in the following order:

```
Request
  |
  v
[1] Trust Proxy (for Replit reverse proxy)
  |
  v
[2] Content Security Policy header
  |
  v
[3] Body Parsing (JSON for API, raw for webhooks)
  |
  v
[4] URL-encoded body parsing
  |
  v
[5] Request logging (method, path, status, duration)
  |
  v
[6] Session middleware (PostgreSQL-backed)
  |
  v
[7] Route handlers (authentication checked per-route)
  |
  v
[8] Error handler (catches unhandled errors, returns JSON)
  |
  v
[9] Vite dev server (development) or static file serving (production)
```

### Route Organization

Routes are organized into the following groups within `routes.ts`:

| Group | Prefix | Auth | Purpose |
|-------|--------|------|---------|
| Wallet Auth | `/api/auth/wallet/*` | None / Native Auth | Authentication and session management |
| User | `/api/auth/me` | Wallet session | Current user data |
| Certifications | `/api/certifications` | Wallet session | Create and list certifications |
| Blockchain | `/api/blockchain/*` | Wallet session | Account info and transaction broadcasting |
| Proof | `/api/proof/:id` | None | Public proof verification |
| Certificates | `/api/certificates/:id.pdf` | None | PDF certificate download |
| Payments | `/api/xmoney/*` | Wallet session | EGLD payments via xMoney ($0.05/cert) |
| Webhooks | `/api/webhooks/xmoney` | Signature verification | xMoney payment callbacks |
| API Keys | `/api/keys` | Wallet session | API key management |
| ACP | `/api/acp/*` | API key / None | Agent Commerce Protocol |
| Discovery | `/.well-known/*`, `/llms.txt`, etc. | None | AI agent discovery endpoints |

---

## Database Design

### Database Engine

PostgreSQL hosted on Neon, accessed via Drizzle ORM with a schema-first approach. The schema is defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle's table builder functions, shared between frontend and backend for type safety.

### Table Details

**sessions** -- Stores Express session data serialized as JSONB. Used by `connect-pg-simple` for server-side session persistence. An index on `expire` supports automatic cleanup.

**users** -- Wallet-based user profiles keyed by MultiversX wallet address (`erd1...`). Each user has usage tracking (monthly count and reset date).

**certifications** -- File certification records. Each record stores the file metadata (name, hash, type, size), author information, blockchain transaction details (hash, URL, status), and visibility settings. The `file_hash` column has a unique constraint to prevent duplicate certifications of the same file content.

**api_keys** -- API keys for programmatic access. Keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes with a visible prefix (`pm_...`) for identification. Each key is linked to a user and tracks usage (last used, request count).

**acp_checkouts** -- Agent Commerce Protocol checkout sessions. Tracks the lifecycle of AI agent purchases from checkout initiation through payment confirmation and certification creation. Status transitions: pending -> confirmed/expired/failed.

## Blockchain Integration Flow

### Client-Side Hashing

```
[1] User selects file in browser
      |
[2] File read as ArrayBuffer
      |
[3] crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", buffer) computes hash
      |
[4] Hash converted to lowercase hexadecimal string (64 characters)
      |
[5] Hash displayed to user, file content discarded from memory
```

The Web Crypto API provides hardware-accelerated SHA-256 hashing. Files of any size can be processed without uploading to the server.

### Transaction Creation and Signing

```
[1] Transaction object created with:
    - nonce: current account nonce from MultiversX API
    - value: 0 (no EGLD transfer)
    - sender: user's wallet address
    - receiver: user's wallet address (self-transaction)
    - data: "xproof:certify:<hash>|filename:<name>|author:<author>"
    - gasLimit: 150000 + (data_bytes * 1500)
    - chainID: "1" (mainnet)
      |
[2] Transaction sent to wallet provider for signing
    - xPortal app signs via WalletConnect relay
    - Web Wallet redirects for signing
    - Browser extension signs inline
    - 120-second timeout for Guardian/2FA flows
      |
[3] Signed transaction broadcast via MultiversX SDK TransactionManager
      |
[4] Transaction hash returned to client
```

### Server-Side Recording (ACP Flow)

For Agent Commerce Protocol certifications, the server can record hashes directly using a configured private key:

```
[1] Server constructs transaction with certify:<hash> data payload
      |
[2] Transaction signed with ed25519 private key (server-side)
      |
[3] Transaction submitted to MultiversX gateway API
      |
[4] Transaction hash stored in certification record
```

### Blockchain Status Tracking

Certification records have a `blockchain_status` field with three possible values:

- **pending** -- Transaction created but not yet confirmed on-chain
- **confirmed** -- Transaction included in a finalized block
- **failed** -- Transaction rejected or timed out

---

## Authentication Flow

### MultiversX Native Auth

xproof uses MultiversX Native Auth, a cryptographic authentication mechanism where users prove wallet ownership by signing a challenge message.

```

```

### Session Management

Sessions are stored in PostgreSQL via `connect-pg-simple`. The session contains the authenticated `walletAddress`. Session cookies are configured with:

- `secure: true` in production (HTTPS only)
- `httpOnly: true` (not accessible via JavaScript)
- `sameSite: lax` (CSRF protection)
- 24-hour maximum age

### Route Protection

Protected routes use the `isWalletAuthenticated` middleware, which checks for `req.session.walletAddress`. If absent, the request is rejected with HTTP 401.

## Payment Processing Flow

### xMoney EGLD Payments

Certifications cost $0.05, paid in EGLD at the real-time market rate (fetched from CoinGecko with a 5-minute cache).

```
[1] POST /api/xmoney/create-payment
    - Fetches current EGLD/USD rate from CoinGecko API (5-minute cache)
    - Creates xMoney order with EGLD amount
    - Returns payment URL for redirect

[2] User redirected to xMoney payment page
    - Pays in EGLD via MultiversX wallet
      |
[3] xMoney sends webhook to POST /api/webhooks/xmoney
    - HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (constant-time comparison)
    - On success: updates order status, triggers certification
      |
[4] GET /api/xmoney/order/:orderId polls for status (client-side fallback)

## Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP) Flow

The ACP enables AI agents to programmatically purchase certifications using API keys.

### Discovery

AI agents discover xproof capabilities through multiple standard endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/.well-known/ai-plugin.json` | OpenAI ChatGPT Plugin manifest |
| `/.well-known/mcp.json` | Model Context Protocol manifest |
| `/.well-known/agent.json` | Agent Protocol manifest |
| `/llms.txt` | LLM-friendly summary |
| `/llms-full.txt` | Extended documentation |
| `/api/acp/openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.0 specification |
| `/agent-tools/langchain.py` | LangChain tool definitions |
| `/agent-tools/crewai.py` | CrewAI tool definitions |
| `/agent-tools/openapi-actions.json` | GPT Actions specification |

### Checkout Flow

```
[1] GET /api/acp/products
    - Returns available products with pricing
    - Product: "blockchain-certification" at $0.05 in EGLD
      |
[2] POST /api/acp/checkout
    Authorization: Bearer pm_<api_key>
    Body: { product_id, file_hash, file_name, author_name }
    - Validates API key
    - Creates checkout record with 30-minute expiry
    - Calculates EGLD amount at current rate
    - Returns checkout_id, payment address, EGLD amount
      |
[3] Agent sends EGLD to payment address
      |
[4] POST /api/acp/confirm
    Authorization: Bearer pm_<api_key>
    Body: { checkout_id, tx_hash }
    - Verifies transaction on MultiversX blockchain
    - Records certification with file hash
    - Returns certification details and proof URL
      |
[5] GET /api/acp/checkout/:id (optional polling)
    - Returns current checkout status
```

## Security Considerations

### File Privacy

Files never leave the user's browser. SHA-256 hashing is performed entirely client-side using the Web Crypto API. Only the hash (a 64-character hexadecimal string) is transmitted to the server and recorded on the blockchain.

### Authentication Security

- Native Auth tokens contain ed25519 cryptographic signatures verified against the MultiversX blockchain
- Token validation checks signature, block hash existence, TTL expiration, and request origin
- Sessions are stored server-side in PostgreSQL, not in client-accessible cookies
- The deprecated `/api/auth/wallet/login` endpoint (which accepted addresses without signatures) returns HTTP 410 Gone

### API Key Security

- API keys are generated as cryptographically random 48-byte hex strings with a `pm_` prefix
- Only the SHA-256 hash of each key is stored in the database
- Keys cannot be recovered after creation; users must generate new ones if lost
- Keys can be revoked immediately via DELETE /api/keys/:keyId

### Webhook Security

- xMoney webhooks use HMAC-SHA256 signature verification with constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
- Webhook endpoints skip JSON body parsing to preserve raw payloads for signature verification

### Content Security Policy

The server sets a restrictive CSP header allowing connections only to MultiversX API domains, WalletConnect relays, and required font/CDN sources. `unsafe-eval` is permitted only because the MultiversX SDK requires it for dynamic code execution.

### Input Validation

- Request bodies are validated using Zod schemas generated from the Drizzle ORM schema via `drizzle-zod`
- Wallet addresses are validated for the `erd1` prefix format
- File hashes are validated as 64-character hexadecimal strings
- Payment amounts are validated against the expected per-certification price
