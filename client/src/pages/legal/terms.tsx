            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Purpose of the service</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              xproof is a digital certification service that allows you to record 
              proof of existence of files on the MultiversX blockchain. The service 
              generates a cryptographic fingerprint (SHA-256 hash) of your files and records it 
              permanently on the blockchain, thereby creating a timestamped and immutable proof.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Acceptance of terms</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              By using the xproof service, you fully and unconditionally accept these 
              Terms of Use. If you do not accept these terms, 
              you must not use the service.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Registration and authentication</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Access to the service requires a connection via a compatible MultiversX wallet 
              (xPortal, Extension, Web Wallet). The user is responsible for the security of 
              their wallet and private keys.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              xproof never has access to your private keys and cannot recover access to 
              your account in case of loss of your wallet credentials.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Pricing</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The certification service is priced at <strong className="text-foreground">$0.05 per certification</strong>, 
              payable in EGLD (the native cryptocurrency of MultiversX) at the exchange rate in effect 
              at the time of the transaction.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Blockchain network fees (gas fees) are included in this price when 
              payment is made through the integrated payment system. For transactions 
              signed directly by the user, network fees are the user's responsibility.

            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
              <li>Only certify files for which they hold the rights or authorization to certify</li>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              xproof does not claim any rights over the files you certify. Certification 
              does not transfer any intellectual property rights. It solely constitutes 
              proof that the file existed in this form at a given date.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              <strong className="text-foreground">Important:</strong> xproof certification does not constitute 
              proof of ownership or authorship. It only proves the existence 
              of the file at a specific date.

              xproof strives to maintain a reliable and available service, but cannot guarantee:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
              <li>Continuous and uninterrupted availability of the service</li>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">9. Nature of certifications</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              xproof certifications are based on blockchain technology and constitute 
              technical proofs of existence at a given date. Their legal value depends 
              on the applicable legislation and the assessment of the competent courts.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-4">
              xproof recommends consulting a legal professional for any use 
              of certifications in a legal context.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">10. Immutability of blockchain data</h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              By design, data recorded on the blockchain is permanent and 
              immutable. Once a certification is performed, it is technically impossible 
              to modify or delete it. The user is informed of this and expressly accepts 
              it by using the service.

              at any time. Users will be notified of significant changes.

              In case of dispute, and after failure of any attempt at amicable resolution, 
              the competent courts shall have jurisdiction.
